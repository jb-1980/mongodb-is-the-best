This is meant to be a fun, tongue-in-cheek presentation. So nothing should be taken too seriously

This presentation has two objectives:

1.To showcase and discuss some of the features of MongoDB

2.To bring awareness of how we tend to promote our favorite tools, coding languages,
styling practices, etc. as the best solution because of our experience and not
any real data to back it up as "the best".

## It is all relative

All data is related, so why call one database relational and another non-relational?

<Step>
  Can you tell which email is related to which user?

How about now?

### The document model

> "Documents map directly to objects in code, so they are much more natural and
efficient to work with, driving higher development velocity. There is no need to
decompose data across tables, run expensive JOINs to reassemble objects or
integrate a separate ORM layer."  
-- The unprejudiced folks at MongoDB

<Card style={{color: "black"}}>

<Step style={{fontSize: 24}}>

* _An intuitive data model that is fast and easy for developers to work with._ It looks like the code you write!
* A flexible schema that allows for the data model to evolve as application needs change.
* The ability to horizontally scale out. You don't need a centralized database server to handle all your data.

</Step>

# It is just a natural query

Why do ORMs generally make an API like this?

```js
const getUser = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    id: { notIn: [22, 91, 14, 2, 5] },
  },
})
```

Because they know that MQL is just more intuitive than SQL.

### Don't believe it just because someone wrote it on the internet?

<Step>

* MongoDB can't do joins!  
_Not true. Just use the `$lookup` aggregation stage._
* MongoDB doesn't have transactions!  
_Oh really! I wonder what `session.withTransaction()` does?_
* MongoDB is not ACID compliant!  
_Um, MongoDB has always been ACID compliant at the document level,
and since MongoDB version 4, MongoDB is fully ACID compliant across the DB._
* MongoDB is a schemaless database!  
_Maybe?? You don't need to use schemas, but if you want to lock in a schema you can._
* There are other databases that are better than MongoDB!  
_Well, obviously that is wrong. MongoDB is the best database._

### MongoDB is designed to scale

> "Moore's Law's dead... It's completely over"  
-- Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA

<Step>

* Legacy, tabular databases were created before the internet was a thing. You had
to install them from a disc. That means that baked into the design is the assumption that it can
only run on one computer.
* MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally. You can add more servers to your cluster,
and MongoDB will automatically distribute the data across them.
* Storage is cheap, and getting cheaper. CPU's are expensive, and if Moore's Law
is dead, then CPU's are going to get more expensive.

So what direction is the future going?

### Full cloud-based developer data platform

MongoDB Atlas let's you:
<Step>

* Spin up a database cluster in minutes
* Scale your cluster with a click of a button
* Monitor you cluster with Perfomance Advisor and optimize your database
* Connect your data to MongoDB Charts and visualize your data
* Stand up a GraphQL API with MongoDB App Services

</Step>

---

### MongoDB is the best database

In conclusion, MongoDB is the best database because:
* Flexible data model
* Change-friendly design
* Intuitive query language
* Designed to scale
* Full cloud-based developer data platform

### Finally, MongoDB is just better for the environment
